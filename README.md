<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

A graphical user interface for [WorldEdit]. WorldEditCUI is designed
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not [WorldEdit], which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server. 

This version of the mod is for Fabric, but a [LiteLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldeditcui) version is also available.
 
Installation
------------

1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use)
2. Install [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/worldedit-cui) into Minecraft mods folder

WorldEdit selections will be shown without any configuration necessary, but the colours used are configurable when [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) is installed.
